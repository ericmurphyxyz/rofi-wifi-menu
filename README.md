# rofi wifi menu
 
A Wi-Fi menu written in bash. Uses rofi and nmcli. Forked from [zbaylin](https://github.com/zbaylin/rofi-wifi-menu) because it was unmaintained and incompatible with modern versions of rofi. Additional contributions from [vlfldr](https://github.com/vlfldr/rofi-wifi-menu)'s fork.

### Installation

Install `nmcli` and `rofi` with your package manager. If you want to use the icons, set your Rofi font to a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). Then run the following commands:
 
```
git clone https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/rofi-wifi-menu.git
cd rofi-wifi-menu
bash "./rofi-wifi-menu.sh"
```

You'll probably want to put the script in your `$PATH` so you can run it as a command and map a keybinding to it.
